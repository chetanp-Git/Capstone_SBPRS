    "The e-commerce business is quite popular today. Here, you do not need to take orders by going to each customer. A company launches its website to sell the items to the end consumer, and customers can order the products that they require from the same website. Famous examples of such e-commerce companies are Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm and Snapdeal.\n",

       "3  I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

       "1453  We like this shelf, and found it relatively easy to assemble. The assembly directions aren't really complete, but if you've gotten familiar with the companies website it's pretty easy to figure out. Overall, it looks nice, suits our needs, and we're happy to know it's formaldehyde free. Shipping did cause a little damage to the item (dented in a few areas) but it didn't affect it's functionality and I honestly kind of expected it, given that the product is made of recycled paper, which makes the material pretty soft. It probably won't last forever, but that's okay. We're happy to have it for now and to know that it won't expose our new baby or us to any concerning formaldehyde.                                                                                 \n",
       "1531  I'm very sensitive to fragrance - most give me migraines - and this product doesn't smell. At. All. I've always wanted to try this but the price can be intimidating when there is always the possibility that you just won't like it. I finally got to try it when another store was clearancing them out. The phrase \"Love It\" doesn't express enough about how wonderful this product is. Does it get you clean? Yep. Quite well. And I feeling all soft and pampered when I get out of the shower. And its great for guys too. My husband made fun of me when I first brought it home - I had some of the yes to baby carrots baby foam for our girls - and he just told me that he's been using my Yes To Carrots body wash and that he really, really likes it!                          \n",
       "1532  Not all shower gels leave their smell after you use them This one does. I did not have the packaging shown here, but my top would not dispense the shower gel, so when I want to use it I have to take it all the way off, which is annoying.

       "1787  Not one of Elvis's best movies, but it has some good songs in it and parts of the storyline are not too bad. I felt this DVD was not compressed too well, the picture is fuzzy in parts and there are original old-Reel markings in some scenes. The sound is OK but overall it should have been much better quality considering DVD is suppose to be better than VHS.- I would wait for a second release.

What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

       "3  Disappointed. I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

I am 46 years old and I have always had dry, coarse, frizzy hair UNTIL today (: I used the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Conditioner along with another brand of shampoo that I wasn't very impressed with but I was trying to use it up before I began using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo. I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner. I could tell as soon as I had this conditioner in my hands that it was different from anything else I have EVER tried in the past which includes other brands of Keratin shampoos, conditioners treatments. I've tried Wen, Biolage - everything and nothing has come close to this product. I don't what's in this stuff but I love it! It's extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY. I have Lupus and I wasn't feeling well so I skipped the leave in products that I normally have to cover my hair with to control the frizz and get a little softness. I fell asleep with my hair still damp. When I awoke I could not believe it was MY hair on my head! I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair. I kept saying to my self ''this can't be MY hair!. I never have soft hair, NEVER! I am so excited that I've decided to toss the rest of my old shampoo out so that I can begin using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo along with the conditioner. I will purchase this stuff as long as I can get my hands on it!!</td>\n",

       "3625   Impressive!. I am 46 years old and I have always had dry, coarse, frizzy hair UNTIL today (: I used the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Conditioner along with another brand of shampoo that I wasn't very impressed with but I was trying to use it up before I began using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo. I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner. I could tell as soon as I had this conditioner in my hands that it was different from anything else I have EVER tried in the past which includes other brands of Keratin shampoos, conditioners treatments. I've tried Wen, Biolage - everything and nothing has come close to this product. I don't what's in this stuff but I love it! It's extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY. I have Lupus and I wasn't feeling well so I skipped the leave in products that I normally have to cover my hair with to control the frizz and get a little softness. I fell asleep with my hair still damp. When I awoke I could not believe it was MY hair on my head! I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair. I kept saying to my self ''this can't be MY hair!. I never have soft hair, NEVER! I am so excited that I've decided to toss the rest of my old shampoo out so that I can begin using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo along with the conditioner. I will purchase this stuff as long as I can get my hands on it!!   \n",

       "29627  A Dream Come True. For someone who has thin and quickly oiled roots and dry ends this stuff is great. It is awsome when use with the clay mask and shampoo, and it is also good on its own. I saw a definite couple day difference in my hair being oily when I used it all together. I didn't see as much of a difference on its own. I typically wash my hair once a week and this definitely helped me feel dry as the week progressed.

       "29410  A Dream Come True. For someone who has thin and quickly oiled roots and dry ends this stuff is great. It is awsome when use with the clay mask and shampoo, and it is also good on its own. I saw a definite couple day difference in my hair being oily when I used it all together. I didn't see as much of a difference on its own. I typically wash my hair once a week and this definitely helped me feel dry as the week progressed. ( I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my own honest review) This review was collected as part of a promotion.   \n",

       "3  I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",

It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting.

       "3  I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.   \n",
